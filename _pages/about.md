I'm **Michael Mathu Kariuki**, a cybersecurity learner, multimedia producer, and aspiring AI innovator.  
Currently studying **Cyber Security with Cyber Shujaa** and pursuing a **Bachelor of Business and Information Technology (BBIT)** at Kabarak University.

I believe in combining secure digital tools with storytelling to empower Kenya’s youth and protect our digital future.

My work has spanned podcast production, IT infrastructure modernisation, and training young creatives in digital media.  
Now, I’m diving deep into cybersecurity, digital forensics, and secure systems engineering.

> Always learning. Always building.
