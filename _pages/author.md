## Michael Mathu Kariuki

**Cybersecurity learner | Multimedia producer | AI enthusiast**

I'm a passionate IT and multimedia professional currently studying **Cyber Security with Cyber Shujaa** and pursuing a **BBIT degree at Kabarak University**. I believe in combining secure digital tools with creative storytelling to empower Kenya’s youth and protect our growing digital landscape.

My experience spans **film production, podcasting, AI tools**, and **network security**. I’ve led media and IT infrastructure projects, produced short documentaries, and now I'm transitioning into cyber security with hands-on labs and certifications.
